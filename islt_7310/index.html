            <h3>About me:</h3>
            
            <p>Hello, my name is Wendy Dawson. I am currently a student in the Master of Library &amp; Information Science program at the iSchool in University of Missouri’s School of Information Science and Learning Technologies. I completed a B.A. from Utah State University in Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences with an English minor. My professional life builds from the foundation of my personal life and commitment to God, families, country, and community. I am preparing for the future to become an information professional and librarian. I hope to be able to help others navigate the information environment, develop a love for lifelong learning, and more deeply connect to and understand the value of libraries. In my spare time, I love to spend time with my husband and kids, visit libraries and museums, play sports, run, read, be outdoors (especially at the beach) and learn new things.</p>
