     Hello, my name is Wendy Dawson. I am currently a student in the Master of Library & Information Science program. I live in Delaware. My husband is in the Air Force. We have five children and I returned to school after being a stay-at-home mother (which I loved) for 15 years. I have no experience in web application or development, but since computers are becoming increasingly essential to life, I decided to take this course. My expectations for this course are a blend of hoping to learn more about web development as well as hoping that I can pass. I think I would like to develop a personal website one day although I am unsure of the content. In my spare time, I love to spend time with my husband and kids, visit libraries and museums, play sports, run, read, be outdoors (especially at the beach) and learn new things.
